    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Little bit of chicken, little bit of Thai Basil, not
        really too much more to explain, a simple but classic meal served 
        over rice. Can be modified depending on spice preference, but 
        I usually make it without chillies.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Three chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>One large onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>Thai Basil</li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Thai Green Chilis</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start cooking 1 and half cups of rice, or however much you think you can eat in two meals</li>
        <li>Slice chicken into little cubes and throw it into a pan on high heat (with oil in it in case you needed to know that)</li>
        <li>While chicken is cooking, throw in your whole onion (diced)</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix up your sauce, around 2 teaspoons of fish sauce, 1/3 of a cup soy sauce, 3/4 cup chicken broth, ~6 cloves of diced garlic, and two tablespoons of brown sugar</li>
        <li>Add sauce to pan, lower heat a bit</li>
        <li>Let sauce simmer down to the point where it is nice and viscous, then turn off heat and add in a ludicrous amount of spinach and Basil</li>
        <li>At this point if you feeling spicy with it and some sliced green chillies</li>
        <li>Throw that stuff over some rice and consume</li>
    </ol>
