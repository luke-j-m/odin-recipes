    <p>What an absolutely classic meal, based on Gordon Ramsey's mothers Shepherd's pie, this is my recollection
        of the classic fall/winter time dish. Prepare yourself for a legendary experience of one the most 
        hearty and flavourfull meals that can possibly be made.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Ground Turkey or Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Shallots</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>Red Wine</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Herbs De Provence</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat pan on medium-high heat, add olive oil and put in ground turkey/beef when oil is hot</li>
        <li>Add in herbs after meat is mostly cooked, while meat is cooking, cut up shallots and carrots</li>
        <li>Quickly quarter the potatoes and put them in a pot with ROOM TEMPERATURE water, then boil</li>
        <li>Create a well in the meat and pour some more oil in, then add shallots and when shallots are sweating add carrots</li>
        <li>Once shallots are nicely cooked, add in a ridiculous amount of Worcestershire sauce, seriously theres no measurements around here</li>
        <li>Add in a good amount of red wine but make sure you have some left to drink with dinner, lower heat so meat and veggies are simmering, getting nice and tasty.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350</li>
        <li>At this point you should be able to stick a fork through the potatoes with minimal effort, remove water and add butter and milk to potatoes and mash</li>
        <li>Pour meat mixture out of pan into glass dish or something, use spatual to layer mash potatoes on top</li>
        <li>Put Pie into oven for around 10 minutes, with a couple minutes left, sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top</li>
        <li>Try not to get too excited, pour yourself a glass of wine and enjoy</li>
    </ol>
