    <p>
        One day in the summer before my fourth year of university, my friend Landon had a couple buddies over for dinner.
        He made us an unnamed dish that was extremely tasty and easy to make. I made it so many times at our house that 
        my housemate Aaron named it simply "The Dish". Very simple, ground beef, onions, chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, brown 
        sugar, peanuts. Come on, just stop complaining and cook up The Dish.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>One large onion</li>
        <li>Bok Choi</li>
        <li>Snap Peas</li>
        <li>Chili Garlic Sauce</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Peanuts</li>
        <li>Udon Noodles</li>
        <li>Chicken or Beef Broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat pan on medium-high heat, add olive oil and put in ground beef when oil is hot</li>
        <li>When meat is fairly cooked, add in diced onions</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix 1 and a half cups of equal parts soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, and brown sugar (1/2 cup each do the math)</li>
        <li>Add sauce to meat, lower heat and let simmer</li>
        <li>At this point, I kind of just interpret if I need some extra broth to make it a bit more liquidy so I can throw the noodles right in the pan</li>
        <li>Throw two packs of Udon noodles straight in the pan like an animal</li>
        <li>When noodles are cooked and meat is looking nice and juicy, add in chopped Bok Choi and snap peas</li>
        <li>Once Bok Choi is whilted, remove from pan and eat, how hard was that?</li>
    </ol>
